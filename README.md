# About

After creating [`Tiden`](https://tiden-ai.netlify.app) with Next, I wanted a new portfolio but also wanted to continue learning the framework. I ended up with a dynamic, responsive, and chic User Experience that I am proud of. I used TailwindCSS for styling my own components. Some refactoring is underway do to a better understanding of App Router and new clarity with Server Actions (Combined with Supabase make for a grrreat DX imo, non-injectable server-side with RLS).
