Unfortunately, Toast Tab wouldn't give us write access unless the restaurant I worked at moved up payment tiers. I started this project at the end of my Salesforce studies for the Admin Exam, initially believeing I would use the Salesforce API as a Database. I ended up being drawn to web stacks and decided to learn a more traditional Backend/DB in Firebase.",
