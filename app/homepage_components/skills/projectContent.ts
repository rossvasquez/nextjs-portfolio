It was my attempt at solving a real world problem, we were a college town hit that constantly did caterings for U of Iowa Atheltics and EDU Departments, all of this is still managed with pen and paper over the phone and email. Unfortunately, Toast Tab wouldn't give us write access unless the restaurant I worked at moved up on payment tiers. I started this project at the end of my Salesforce studies for the Admin Exam, initially believeing I would use the Salesforce API as a Database. I ended up being sucked to the allure of web stacks and instead just learned how to use Firebase.",
